# This is the folder for the project GMS - Give Me Sun.
# It will use two parameters initially, location and time of day, year.

# The deal is to use street data about location and height of buildings together with information on the height of the sun to give an estimate of where and when there will be shadow/sun.

# Motivation comes from living in Denmark, where the sun is rare (except for 2018 summer) but when the sun is finally there, and you are off work, where should you go.

# The initial version will just be based on bulding heights. Further developments would also include trees, inclined structures etc, and make a visualization of the sun/shadow areas throughout the day.

# Additionally, one could request, where is there sun at time of day, and get locations with over a given time amount left. Or give location and get a sun visualization throughout the day.

# Finally the actual weather could of course also be accounted for.
